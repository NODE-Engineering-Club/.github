# üåä The Open Waters Initiative

An open-source, student-built autonomous surface vessel for learning, experimentation, and global sharing.

## What is The Open Waters Initiative?

The Open Waters Initiative is a hands-on, open-source engineering project where students ‚Äî many with no formal engineering background ‚Äî design and build an autonomous ship using salvaged materials, off-the-shelf electronics, and open tools. Our goal is to democratize access to real-world autonomous systems, starting with the water. 

This project was created under the [NODE Engineering Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/iaac-engineering-club/?viewAsMember=true), a student-led initiative that blends architecture and engineering into tangible, mission-driven education. 

This initiative is possible thanks to the [NODE Engineering Club Contributors](https://github.com/IaaC-Engineering-Club/reports/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md)
