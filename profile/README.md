# 🌊 The Open Waters Initiative

An open-source, student-built autonomous surface vessel for learning, experimentation, and global sharing.

## What is this project?

The Open Waters Initiative is a hands-on, open-source engineering project where students — many with no formal engineering background — design and build an autonomous ship using salvaged materials, off-the-shelf electronics, and open tools. Our goal is to democratize access to real-world autonomous systems, starting with the water.

This project was created under the IAAC Engineering Club, a student-led initiative that blends architecture and engineering into tangible, mission-driven education.
